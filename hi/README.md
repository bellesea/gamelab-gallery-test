In this workshop you'll learn how to make a chart generator using [Chart.js](https://www.chartjs.org), a free open-source JavaScript library for data visualization. Follow along and see how easy it is!

Here you can find a [live demo](https://chart-generator-def.wollygfx.repl.co) and here, you will find the [source code](https://repl.it/@wollygfx/Chart-generator-def#index.htmll).

## Set Up

This workshop requires a very basic knowledge of the following languages: HTML & JS. Don’t worry if you get stuck at some point in the workshop, everything is explained for you to understand!

For this workshop we will use [Repl.it](https://repl.it), a free, online code editor. Click [here](https://repl.it/languages/html) to create a coding environment.

![Setup](https://cloud-qbmylslty.vercel.app/0image.png)

## HTML

Alright, the first thing we have to do is to load Chart.js into our HTML document. To do this, we are going to paste the following code inside of our `<head>` tag. 
```html
<script src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/Chart.js/2.9.4/Chart.min.js"></script>
```
This allows us to use Chart.js without having to download it. Learn about CDNs [here](https://www.cloudflare.com/es-la/learning/cdn/what-is-a-cdn/).

The next thing we have to do is to create a [canvas](https://www.w3schools.com/html/html5_canvas.asp) element inside of our `body` tag, and give it an **id**. Our chart will be drawn in this canvas.
```html
<canvas id="myChart"></canvas>
```

Additionally, we have to create inside of a `div` container, 2 input elements and 3 buttons with the following attributes and values.
```html
<canvas id="myChart"></canvas>
<div>
  <input id="data" type="number" placeholder="Data">
  <input id="label" type="text" placeholder="Data's Label">

  <button onclick="addData(myChart)">Add Data</button>
  <button onclick="removeData(myChart)">Remove Data</button>
  <button onclick="saveCanvas()">Save Chart</button>
</div>
```
Notice that the 2 input elements have the attribute `type` but with different values. The `number` type is used to let the user enter a number, and the `text` type create basic single-line text fields. These inputs also have the attribute `placeholder`, which specifies a short hint that describes the expected value of an input field.

Also, you can see that the `button` elements have the `onclick` attribute. Tthis is actually an [event handler](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Guide/Events/Event_handlers). When the button is clicked, the specified function will run.

Here's how our HTML document looks so far:

![HTML DOM](https://cloud-3q20mqjc9.vercel.app/0image.png)

## CSS

Now that we have our HTML document ready, we should style it a little bit to make it look better. So, go ahead and click on the `style.css` file located in the **Files** tab.

First, we need to align all the input and button elements to the center.

```css
div {
  display: flex;
  justify-content: center;
}
```
Let's break this down:

- The `display` property sets whether an element is treated as a [block or inline element](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Flow_Layout) and the layout used for its children, such as [flow layout](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Flow_Layout), [grid](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Grid_Layout) or [flex](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Flexible_Box_Layout).
- The `justify-content` property defines how the browser distributes space between and around content items along the [main-axis](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Main_Axis) of a flex container, and the inline axis of a grid container.
- In CSS, this is what's known as flexbox. [Learn more about flexbox here!](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/)

When you click on the green *Run* button at the top of your repl, you'll see that the elements are perfectly aligned to the center.

![Div aligned to the center](https://cloud-48yrakqtz.vercel.app/0image.png)

Cool! – But our elements also look very boring right now. So let's style them a little bit!

```css
button {
  background-color: #ffe0e6;
  border: 2px solid #fbabbb;
  border-radius: 5px;
  padding: 7px 16px;
  margin:0 2px 0 0;
  color: #7b7a7a;
  cursor: pointer;
}

input{
  background-color: #ffe0e6;
  border: 2px solid #fbabbb;
  border-radius: 5px;
  padding: 5px;
  margin:0 2px 0 0;
}
```

Here, we're giving the `button` and `input` elements:
- A background color
- A border (with a color too)
- a border radius
- And some other stuff that you can see here:

Cool, our website looks a lot better now!

## JavaScript

Now, let's move to the fun part of the workshop. Go ahead and click on the `script.js` file located in the **Files tab**. 

![Fun gif](https://cloud-n5xpv2pg5.vercel.app/0file_from_ios.gif)

### Setting up the canvas

First we'll need to get the context for our canvas. The [canvas context](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTMLCanvasElement/getContext) is an object with properties and methods that you can use to render graphics inside the **canvas** element.

```js
var canvas = document.getElementById('myChart');
var ctx = canvas.getContext('2d');
```

1. First, we are creating a variable named `canvas`, that gets the canvas element using the `getElementById()` method.
2. Then, we are creating another variable named `ctx`, that uses the `getContext()` method to return the drawing context of the canvas, which is `2d`.

### Creating a chart

Now, we're going to create a chart with some colors and a few cool options that will be useful later.

```js
var myChart = new Chart(ctx, {
  type: 'bar',
  data: {
    datasets: [{
      label: '',
      backgroundColor: [
        'rgba(255, 99, 132, 0.2)',
        'rgba(54, 162, 235, 0.2)',
        'rgba(255, 206, 86, 0.2)',
        'rgba(75, 192, 192, 0.2)',
        'rgba(153, 102, 255, 0.2)',
        'rgba(255, 159, 64, 0.2)'
      ],
      borderColor: [
        'rgba(255, 99, 132, 1)',
        'rgba(54, 162, 235, 1)',
        'rgba(255, 206, 86, 1)',
        'rgba(75, 192, 192, 1)',
        'rgba(153, 102, 255, 1)',
        'rgba(255, 159, 64, 1)'
      ],
      borderWidth: 1
    }]
  },
    
  options: {
    scales: {
      yAxes: [{
        ticks: {
          beginAtZero: true
        }
      }]
    }
  }
});

```
Let's break this down:

1. In a variable called `chart`, we are creating a new `Chart` object.
2. This object has 2 essential elements: the `type` element, which specifies what type of chart we want to be rendered, and the `data` element, which contains a series of datasets and labels that will be used to render the chart.
3. The `backgroundColor:` and `borderColor:` elements set the background and border color for each bar respectively using [rgba colors](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_colors_rgb.asp).
4. The `borderWidth` element sets the width for the border.
5. The `options` element is used to configure the chart in different ways.

Here's what the code above will render:

### Types of charts

Chart.js allows us to use up to 7 built-in charts types, and you can even create your own chart type.

Here are some of them:

<details>

<summary>Bar</summary>

</details>

<details>

<summary>Line</summary>

</details>

<details>

<summary>Doughnut and Pie</summary>

![Doughnot and pie charts](https://cloud-hh4vxew90.vercel.app/0image.png)

</details>

<details>

<summary>Polar area</summary>

![Polar area chart](https://cloud-4x3lxyzvi.vercel.app/0image.png)

</details>

### Data

Now we have our chart, but we need to get data from somewhere. So, we're going to create a function that takes the input elements and gets their values. Then, using Chart.js methods, we'll push that data into our chart.
```js
function addData(chart) {
  chart.data.labels.push(document.getElementById("label").value);
  chart.data.datasets.forEach((dataset) => {
    dataset.data.push(document.getElementById("data").value);
  });
  chart.update();
}
```

- We are creating a function called `addData`. This function will be called whenever the user clicks on the **Add Data** button.
- Then we are taking the variable `chart` (where the Chart object is in), and using its methods:
  - The `data` method gets the data array from the object `chart`.
  - The `labels` method gets the `labels` array from the `data` array.
  - The `push` method adds data to the `labels` array. This data is gotten using the methods `document.getElementById()` and `value`.
- Then we do the same thing, but this time we'll get the `datasets` array from the `data` array, and using the `forEach()` method we'll call a function that will execute for every `dataset` in our `datasets` array.
- Finally, we use the `update` method to update the chart once the data is gotten.

Here's the result of the code above:

![Result](https://cloud-l9cwjcuh7.vercel.app/0screen_recording_2020-12-23_at_1.04.00_pm.gif)

Now, we'll create a function that removes data from the chart. We'll do it the same way as the past function, but this time we'll use the `pop` method instead of the `push` method.

```js
function removeData(chart) {
  chart.data.labels.pop();
  chart.data.datasets.forEach((dataset) => {
    dataset.data.pop();
  });
  chart.update();
} 
```

Let's see if it works:

![Result](https://cloud-goab5uq2w.vercel.app/0screen_recording_2020-12-24_at_11.31.05_am.gif)

Nice! – Now, the last thing we have to do is to create a function that saves the chart as a png image.

```js
function saveCanvas() {
  var image = canvas.toDataURL();  
  var tmpLink = document.createElement('a');  
  tmpLink.download = 'my_chart.png';
  tmpLink.href = image;  
  document.body.appendChild(tmpLink);  
  tmpLink.click();  
  document.body.removeChild(tmpLink);  
}
```

This is what the code above does:

1. Convert the canvas to a [data url](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Basics_of_HTTP/Data_URIs), and store that url in the variable image.
2. Create an HTML link element using the method `document.createElement()`
3. Set the `download` attribute of the `link` element to `my_chart.png`. This is what the downloaded file gets saved as.
4. Set the `href` attribute of the `link` element to the data url acquired in step 1. This will cause that to be the image that is downloaded when the link is clicked.
5. Append the link to the end of the page, so that it is part of the website
6. Automatically trigger a click event on the link with JavaScript
7. Remove the link from the website, so it's no longer visible

Now, let's try it:
